      <h3>When David Yarrow snapped one of the most iconic sports photographs ever taken, he was, by his own admission, "merely a fan with a camera."</h3>
      <span class="byline">WRITTEN BY: ERIKA PARRA</span>
      <p>It was the final of the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, and at age 20, he was sitting pitchside. Yarrow -- who's since made millions off his work -- had only started taking pictures of soccer matches in Scotland for a local magazine the year before, while studying at university. Traveling to the World Cup as a freelancer, he unexpectedly received accreditation from the Scottish Football Association after he arrived. But thanks to a rule allowing each nation to have an accredited photographer on the field -- and the fact that he was the only Scottish shooter who stuck around after his country was eliminated -- he found himself in a fortuitous spot.</p>

      <p>Right after Argentina beat West Germany to take the title, fans swarmed the pitch and the winning team lifted up its captain, Diego Armando Maradona. Yarrow rushed up to the scene and snapped his now-famous photo of Maradona in the air with his arms raised, smiling. The image went on to be syndicated and appeared in publications around the world.</p>

        <h2>"It's a special picture," Yarrow said in a phone interview. "I was lucky. My wide angle lens wasn't great, but he looked right at me. And it showed the importance of getting close."</h2>

      <p>Surprisingly, this didn't immediately kick off Yarrow's career as a photographer. In 1988, he took a job at a bank instead, and later financed his own hedge fund. When the financial crisis hit in 2008, however, his world collapsed. Photography had always been at the back of his mind, and he started plotting his way to it as a career.</p>

      <p>I had financial responsibilities. I had to be a photographer that was earning quite a bit of money to be able to look after things in my life," he said. "So I spent four years working towards the day where I knew that I could earn enough income as a photographer that I could take that risk.</p>
